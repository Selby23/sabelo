            <font size="5">Mzamomtsha Primary School is located between Khayelistha Township and Umfuleni Township in the <br>
              Western Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa. The schools headmaster, Mr. Simphiwe Khuze, joined in 2007. <br>
              The school is located in a semi-township called Drift Sands which started off as an informal settlement. <br>
              Drift Sands has since been developed and with support from the South African government it turned into a <br>
              sprawling township with state of the art housing units. Mzamomtsha Primary School is plays a key role in Drift Sands <br>
              and is supporting the local community.The school was initially created for primary school students from grade 1 to grade 7, <br>
              but due to the rapid population growth (births and migration) the school is also enrolling higher grades. Students are allowed <br>
              up to grade 12 - which is the metric year.
